    "#### **Experiment 4.2 Summary**:\n",
    "1. Biasness: as we expected, when data is highly corrected, the bias is amplified (Figure 4.21 vs Figure 4.22), the effect dimishing with the reduce of LD level. However, the common variants groups show higher bias compared with all variants groups.\n",

    "#### **Conclusion**:\n",
    "MAF influences both standard error and efficiency: restricting to common variants reduces variance and improves convergence speed. However, MAF also impacts bias, particularly under high LD conditions, where common variants groups unexpectedly showed greater bias than all variants groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Thinking**:\n",
    "Why do common variants exhibit higher bias than all variants? Is it possible that the common varaints shows higher LD since we use threshold to prune LD\n",
